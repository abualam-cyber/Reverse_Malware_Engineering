# Reverse_Malware_Engineering

Documentation:

This cross-platform application is a parallel disassembler tool for analyzing binary files. It utilizes the Capstone library for disassembly, TBB for parallel processing, and SPDLOG for logging. The tool reads binary files, disassembles them into human-readable instructions, and logs the output to a specified file.

How to Use:

1. Installation: Ensure that the necessary dependencies (Capstone, TBB, Boost Program Options, SPDLOG) are installed on your system.
2. Compile: Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Make sure to link against the required libraries.
3. Command Line Usage: Run the compiled executable from the command line with the following arguments:
    # --input-file <filename>: Specify the binary file to disassemble.
    # --log-file <filename>: Specify the log file to save the disassembly output.
    # --log-type <type>: Specify the type of log file (txt, json, console).
    # --arch <architecture>: Specify the target architecture (x86, x86_64, arm, arm64).
    # --mode <mode>: Specify the mode (32 or 64 bits).
    # --options <options>: (Optional) Specify additional disassembly options (syntax_only, skip_data, detail).
4. Execution: The tool will read the binary file, disassemble it in parallel, and log the instructions to the specified log file.
5. Output: Check the log file for the disassembled instructions. Each instruction is preceded by its memory address.
By following these steps, users can effectively analyze binary files using parallel disassembly.
